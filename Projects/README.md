# Pet Dog Project

This website is a barebones interactive website. Inside you will see a picture of my dog Juno. If you hover over the image, your cursor will change icons. Also if you click on the image or if you click on the button below the image, the number of pets will increase by 1. This project followed from the in-class session given by Dr. Bart on 9/9/21.

Project began: 9/9/21

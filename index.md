## Change Log
-Week of Aug. 30 began marksheet.io and runestone.academy lessons on html and css. I used these lessons to create html and css "cheat sheets." These are located in this repository under [The_Basics](https://github.com/jwdagney55/jwdagney55.github.io/tree/main/The_Basics)
-Tutorial from FreeCodeAcademy. Beginning the Responsive Web Design course, and completed the First section on html. Repository is located [here](https://github.com/jwdagney55/CISC275-Tutorials)
-Sept. 9 created "interactive" html + javascript website around my dog called "Pet-the-Dog.html". Can "pet" the dog by clicking and update the pet counter. [location](https://github.com/jwdagney55/jwdagney55.github.io/tree/main/Projects). The location is within this repository, as I am keeping small scale projects local to this repository.

## To Do

## Change Log
### Portfolio Milestone 2
- Watched video tutorial on [Creating a Flip Card with Animation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrZFo1jLG-4). This led into creating a basic match game in React with TypeScript. Code is housed in this [repository](https://github.com/jwdagney55/react-match-game).
- Read through [htmldog](https://htmldog.com/guides/javascript/) javascript beginner and intermediate lessons.
######################################################################
- Week of Aug. 30 began marksheet.io and runestone.academy lessons on html and css. I used these lessons to create html and css "cheat sheets." These are located in this repository under [The_Basics](https://github.com/jwdagney55/jwdagney55.github.io/tree/main/The_Basics)
- Tutorial from FreeCodeAcademy. Beginning the Responsive Web Design course, and completed the First section on html. Repository is located [here](https://github.com/jwdagney55/CISC275-Tutorials)
- Sept. 9 created "interactive" html + javascript website around my dog called "Pet-the-Dog.html". Can "pet" the dog by clicking and update the pet counter. The location is within this [repository](https://github.com/jwdagney55/jwdagney55.github.io/tree/main/Projects), as I am keeping small scale projects local to this repository.

## To Do
### Portfolio Milestone 2
- Figure out how to put images (.jpg and .png) into a react project!
- Create new project for an exercise tracker (with logging feature). Implement bootstrap in this react project.
- Add randomizability feature to Match Game, so the cards aren't the same each time (i.e. create a new game on refresh).
- Add smarts to Match Game, can only have two guesses open at once, then it flips them over. Keep found matches turned over.
- Finish and compile the reflection for the JavaScript htmldog tutorial.

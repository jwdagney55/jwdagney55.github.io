## Change Log
### Portfolio Milestone 3
- Watched Dr. Bart's YouTube video ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8eYF6cUi5c)) on creating a React App TA Trainer. Forked his repository and made minimal tests in my own [repository](https://github.com/jwdagney55/ta-trainer). GitHub pages is not currently working with this repo.
- Created randomization of cards in Match Game. Repository can be found [here](https://github.com/jwdagney55/react-match-game). Though the first line in the commit messages says
"Not working! Adding random card assignment," rest assured it works.
- Created github pages branch of match game repository to host the game through the internet. Web page can be found [here](https://jwdagney55.github.io/react-match-game/).
- I did figure out how to put images into react projects. It is honestly much more complicated that I would like it to be. I had to put them in the public folder to access them by their file name rather than an object/module that I imported. With their file name I can more easily select which card images I want to use.

### Portfolio Milestone 2
- Watched video tutorial on [Creating a Flip Card with Animation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrZFo1jLG-4). This led into creating a basic match game in React with TypeScript. Code is housed in this [repository](https://github.com/jwdagney55/react-match-game). I have not configured yarn yet for React to work with github pages. The file which is the website, however is: [https://github.com/jwdagney55/react-match-game/blob/main/src/index.tsx](https://github.com/jwdagney55/react-match-game/blob/main/src/index.tsx)
- Read through [htmldog](https://htmldog.com/guides/javascript/) javascript beginner and intermediate lessons. Notes are [here](https://github.com/jwdagney55/jwdagney55.github.io/blob/main/The_Basics/JavaScript.txt).

### Portfolio Milestone 1
- Week of Aug. 30 began marksheet.io and runestone.academy lessons on html and css. I used these lessons to create html and css "cheat sheets." These are located in this repository under [The_Basics](https://github.com/jwdagney55/jwdagney55.github.io/tree/main/The_Basics) ([HTML Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/jwdagney55/jwdagney55.github.io/blob/main/The_Basics/HTML-CheatSheet.html) [CSS Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/jwdagney55/jwdagney55.github.io/blob/main/The_Basics/CSS_TestSite.html))
- Tutorial from FreeCodeAcademy. Beginning the Responsive Web Design course, and completed the First section on html. Repository is located [here](https://github.com/jwdagney55/CISC275-Tutorials)
- Sept. 9 created "interactive" html + javascript website around my dog called "Pet-the-Dog.html". Can "pet" the dog by clicking and update the pet counter. The location is within this [repository](https://github.com/jwdagney55/jwdagney55.github.io/tree/main/Projects), as I am keeping small scale projects local to this repository. Here is the [website](https://github.com/jwdagney55/jwdagney55.github.io/blob/main/Projects/Pet-the-Dog.html).
